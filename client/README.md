# MERN Stack Integration â€“ Blog Application

This project is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete blog posts. It demonstrates seamless integration between the frontend and backend, with database operations, API communication, and state management. The backend is built with Express.js and connects to MongoDB using Mongoose. It exposes RESTful API endpoints such as GET /api/posts to fetch all posts, GET /api/posts/:id for a single post, POST /api/posts to create a post, PUT /api/posts/:id to update a post, and DELETE /api/posts/:id to remove a post. The frontend is built with React.js and Vite, featuring components like PostList.jsx for listing posts, SinglePost.jsx for viewing a single post, PostForm.jsx for creating and editing posts, and Navigation.jsx for site navigation. React Router is used for client-side routing, and a custom hook, useApi.js, handles API requests efficiently with loading and error states. To set up the project, clone the repository, navigate to the server folder to run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to start the backend, then navigate to the client folder to run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to start the frontend. Once running, you can access the application at http://localhost:5173. Key features include full CRUD functionality, category association for posts, form validation, responsive design, and smooth single-page navigation. Below is a screenshot of the application in action: ![App Screenshot](client/schreenshorts.png). This README provides a complete understanding of the project, setup instructions, API usage, implemented features, and a visual preview, all in one comprehensive explanation.
